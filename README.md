## Description

The Migration Connector connects your Shopware 5 shop with Shopware 6 and checks if your Shopware 5 system is ready for data migration. You can migrate a large amount of data from your existing Shopware 5 installation to Shopware 6, including products, manufacturers, customers, etc., and update it at any time. This makes it possible to use both systems and make the transition as easy as possible.



The Migration Connector provides API endpoints that allow Shopware 6 to create a secure data connection with the active Shopware 5 shop.



## Important:

The connection does not modify any data in your active shop. Nevertheless, it is always recommended that you make a backup of your active shop before installing new plugins. With this plugin, all processes take place in the background - no settings or inputs are required. As long as you work with Shopware 6, you should leave the plugin activated. This is the only way to update your data at any given time.



## It's that easy to connect your Shopware 5 Shop with Shopware 6: 



- Download the Migration Connector from the Community Store.
- Install and then activate the plugin via the Plugin Manager in your shop.
- In Shopware 6, you use the Migration Assistant plugin to create an API connection and enter the API key* of your shop. Your username (API user) and your shop domain are also required.
 

*You can find the API key under “User administration” in your shop's administration
